        title: "My First Coding Experience",
        year: 2018,
        description: "I took Computer Science GCSE in secondary school and was taught to code in Python. I quickly discovered I loved writing scripts and solving problems. I began spending my free time at home building text-based applications. One of my favourite projects was a game of hangman that the user could play against the computer. I spent a whole weekend working on it!",

        title: "Cyber Discovery",
        year: 2019,
        description: "I enrolled in the government's CyberStart Cyber Discovery Scheme which was a set of coding puzzles. Many challenges involved looking at the source code of websites to find hidden clues and passwords. This taught me core Cyber Security practices and is also how I learnt to use Chrome DevTools.",

        year: 2021,
        description: "Now an A-Level student, I started learning C#, practising my skills by building simple text-based applications like a Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion calculator. I also started building games using Defold (a games dev engine) and writing code in Lua. I built games like Pong and Space Invaders to test myself.",

        title: "Discovering Web Development",
        year: 2022,
        description: "I learnt about HTML and CSS in Sixth Form and was immediately fascinated. It amazed me that I could create an interactive website in a notepad text editor! I decided to learn more outside of lessons, so I enrolled in an online JavaScript course. Pleased to discover that the syntax was simple and intuitive, I decided to tutor a younger student by teaching them JavaScript as a way to improve their programming skills. Later that year, they achieved an 8 (A* equivalent grade) in their Computer Science GCSE.",

        year: 2023,
        description: "I joined a Cloud Infrastructure Team at Vodafone as part of my Degree Apprenticeship. I gained exposure to AWS and worked on tickets maintaining and debugging Terraform code. I also iteratively developed a Python application and a JavaScript Front-End, demoing my projects to the team and taking their feedback. This year taught me how to work in an agile environment, participating in DSUs, retrospectives and sprint planning.",

        year: 2024,
        description: "I moved to a different team to gain more exposure to front-end development. There, I built, maintained, debugged and migrated security dashboards for customers built in Elastic Kibana. I also taught another Vodafone team how to develop in Kibana by delivering a series of teaching sessions. At University, I learnt to code in React, applying my skills to a full-stack website with ChatBot and RSS feed. Other University projects included a bookstore website and database coded using the LAMP stack, and an object-oriented Python application with a Tkinter GUI.",

I expect to graduate in July with a First Class Honours Degree in Digital and Technology Solutions (Software Engingeering).",
